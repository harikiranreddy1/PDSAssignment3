#This code uses boxplots for visualizing the bootstrap samples' statistics for the blood pressure variable. Above 4 Boxplots indicate stats(mean,standard deviation, 95th percentile, 55th percentile) comparision of 500 samples with 150 observations each against stats of overall population. Each boxplot represents a distribution obtained from a bootstrap sample. The red dashed lines indicate the corresponding statistics from the population. The average mean from bootstrap samples is centered around the population mean. The standard deviations from bootstrap samples vary, but they generally align with the population standard deviation.The 95th and 55th percentiles from bootstrap samples capture the variability seen in the population, indicating a similar distribution.
